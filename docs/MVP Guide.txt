Welcome to Monster World :)
You can grow monsters from seeds in your farm to battle other monster tamers and get even more monsters to grow.
You can also grow food to help raise your monster's stats. 
This will help you in your battles to earn more seeds.

Your monsters have four stats: HP, ATK, DEF, and SPD.
They also have a type that is weak to and strong against another type.
Flower type is strong against fruit type and weak to veggie type.
Fruit type is strong against veggie type and weak to flower type.
Veggie type is strong against flower type and weak to fruit type.
If you use a move that is strong against the enemy monster's type, it will deal double damage.
If you use a move that is weak against the enemy monster's type, it will only do half.
